GASPI stands for Global Address Space Programming Interface and
is a Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) API. It aims at
extreme scalability, high flexibility and failure tolerance for parallel
computing environments. GASPI aims to initiate a paradigm shift from bulk-synchronous two-sided
communication patterns towards an asynchronous communication and
execution model. To that end GASPI leverages remote completion and
one-sided RDMA driven communication in a Partitioned Global Address Space.
