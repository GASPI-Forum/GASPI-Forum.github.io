13.30-14.00 Errata proposals  
14.00-14.15 Lunch break  
14.15-15.00 General text proposals  
15.00-15.15 Voting

            GASPI Standard Library, Task model integration for GASPI, fine grain  
	    local completion.

 

#### Errata Proposals

#### General Text Proposals

Discussion

Daniel: Fine grain local completion  

- Solution 1 - every task using different queue 
- Solution 2 - check every request 
- Solution 3 - remote reply to notification


- Solution 4 -generic meta comm struct.
- Additional comm requests:  
  - gaspi_post_comm(struct*)
  - gaspi_wait_comm(struct*)

#### Discussion

- Is there a remote race ? Local completion does not yet solve
  a potential remote race. Not equivalent to remote reply to notification.
- Can we add the concept of context in addition to a tag ?
- Should this concept include collectives ? (probably not)
- Is there potential for optimization (re-use of strcut, similar to persistant MPI communication )
- Implementation: Should the current functions go into a GASPI library layer (as a wrapper function) ?
- Should we then add tag calls as additonial layer in GASPI standard ?
  - write - tag with notify for group of tags vs write_notify, local_waitsome ?
- What would waitig for queue imply ? Waiting for all requests in comm_structs ?

#### TODO

Daniel:
- Investigate feasability of fine grain completion in cray implementation

BSC + Daniel:
- C++ async wait c# - how would this fit with GASPI.
- Remote race
- OpenMP tasking.

Olaf:
- gaspi_write_notify, errata for empty message. (notification must be send) 

Rui, Mirko:
- Is it possible to set a gaspi config such that queues are ressouce which is requested ?
- is it possible to aggregate ressources requested with subsequent calls to gaspi_proc_init ?


### Tutorials / Hackathon

- Still investigating workshop/hackathon @ CSC Finland

Next meeting:

- Jan, 16 2018 in Frankfurt
