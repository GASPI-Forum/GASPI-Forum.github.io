[HLRS GASPI Tutorial 2016](http://www.hlrs.de/training/2016-06-06-gaspi/) - Efficient Parallel Programming with GASPI.  
In this tutorial we present an asynchronous data flow programming model for Partitioned Global Address Spaces (PGAS) as an alternative to the programming model of MPI. Hands-on sessions (in C and Fortran) will allow users to immediately test and understand the basic constructs of GASPI. This course provides scientific training in Computational Science, and in addition, the scientific exchange of the participants among themselves.
