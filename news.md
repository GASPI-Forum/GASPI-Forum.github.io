[HLRS GASPI Tutorial 2016, Stuttgart, 6/7 June 2016](http://www.hlrs.de/training/2016-06-06-gaspi/)  
GASPI Tutorial - Efficient Parallel Programming with GASPI.  
In this tutorial we present an asynchronous data flow programming model for Partitioned Global Address Spaces (PGAS) as an alternative to the programming model of MPI. Hands-on sessions (in C and Fortran) will allow users to immediately test and understand the basic constructs of GASPI. This course provides scientific training in Computational Science, and in addition, the scientific exchange of the participants among themselves.

[PASC 2016 GASPI Minisymposium, Lausanne, 8/10 June 2016] (http://www.pasc16.org/program/minisymposia/)  
Asynchronous data-flow driven programming with GASPI.  
The mini-symposium will present four talks from different application domains, which make use of (hybrid) task models and the extended feature set (relative to MPI) of the GASPI API in order to deliver high scalability and a much improved robustness versus jitter. The applications domains are from Life-Sciences, Seismic Imaging, from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and from a work-stealing application in Combustion CFD.

[Exa2ct GASPI Tutorial 2016, EPFL Lausanne, 7th June 2016] (http://www.exa2ct.eu/)  
The GASPI tutorial is taking place in room BC 410 (map), located in the "BC building", on the EPFL campus in Lausanne. The meeting is co-located with PASC 2016 and free of charge. In this GASPI tutorial we present an asynchronous data flow programming model for Partitioned Global Address Spaces (PGAS) as an alternative to the programming model of MPI. GASPI, which stands for Global Address Space Programming Interface, is a partitioned global address space (PGAS) API. The GASPI API is designed as a C/C++/Fortran library and focused on three key objectives: scalability, flexibility and fault tolerance. In order to achieve its much improved scaling behaviour GASPI aims at asynchronous dataflow with remote completion, rather than bulk-synchronous message exchanges. GASPI follows a single/multiple program multiple data (SPMD/MPMD) approach and offers a small, yet powerful API (see also http://www.gaspi.de and http://www.gpi-site.com). GASPI is successfully used in academic and industrial simulation applications. Hands-on sessions (in C and Fortran) will allow users to immediately test and understand the basic constructs of GASPI. This course provides scientific training in Computational Science, and in addition, the scientific exchange of the participants among themselves.
