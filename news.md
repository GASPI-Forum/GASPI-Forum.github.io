[HLRS GASPI Tutorial 2016](http://www.hlrs.de/training/2016-06-06-gaspi/) - Efficient Parallel Programming with GASPI.  
In this tutorial we present an asynchronous data flow programming model for Partitioned Global Address Spaces (PGAS) as an alternative to the programming model of MPI. Hands-on sessions (in C and Fortran) will allow users to immediately test and understand the basic constructs of GASPI. This course provides scientific training in Computational Science, and in addition, the scientific exchange of the participants among themselves.

[PASC 2016 GASPI Minisymposium] (http://http://www.pasc16.org/) - Asynchronous data-flow driven programming with GASPI.  
The mini-symposium will present four talks from different application domains, which make use of (hybrid) task models and the extended feature set (relative to MPI) of the GASPI API in order to deliver high scalability and a much improved robustness versus jitter. The applications domains are from Life-Sciences, Seismic Imaging, from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and from a work-stealing application in Combustion CFD.
