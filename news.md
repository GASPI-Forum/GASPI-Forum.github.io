[Innovationszentrum Applied System Modeling GASPI Tutorial 2016, Fraunhofer-Zentrum Z04.07, October, 6-7, 2016, 9 am to 5 pm](http://www.applied-system-modeling.de/veranstaltungen/veranstaltungendetails/artikel/details/course-efficient-parallel-programming-with-gaspi-2-days.html)  
Course »Efficient Parallel Programming with GASPI«  (Training in cooperation with TU-Nachwuchsring).
GPI-2 is the only implementation of the GASPI standard. GPI-2/GASPI is being used in academic and industrial HPC simulation applications. In this Tutorial we present an asynchronous dataflow programming model for Partitioned Global Address Spaces (PGAS). Interoperability with the current programming model standard MPI and threading models will be high-lighted during the course. However no previous knowledge of MPI is assumed. GASPI, which stands for Global Address Space Programming Interface, is a partitioned global address space (PGAS) API. GASPI aims at asynchronous dataflow with remote completion, rather than bulk-synchronous message exchanges. GASPI follows a single/multiple program multiple data (SPMD/MPMD) approach and offers a small, yet powerful API (also see www.gaspi.de).

[GASPI Forum Meeting June 2016, Frankfurt, 22 June 2016, 13.00-17.00](http://www.gaspi.de/)   
The second GASPI Forum Meeting 2016 will take place in Frankfurt parallel to ISC 2016. Room D.00.63, Frankfurt / Main, Hahnstr. 43d (Aculeum), EG.   
The GASPI Forum is an open group and encourages new members to join the forum. For registration, please contact Christian Simmendinger (christian.simmendinger[at]t-systems-sfr.com).

[HLRS GASPI Tutorial 2016, Stuttgart, 6/7 June 2016](http://www.hlrs.de/training/2016-06-06-gaspi/)  
GASPI Tutorial - Efficient Parallel Programming with GASPI.  
In this tutorial we present an asynchronous data flow programming model for Partitioned Global Address Spaces (PGAS) as an alternative to the programming model of MPI. Hands-on sessions (in C and Fortran) will allow users to immediately test and understand the basic constructs of GASPI. This course provides scientific training in Computational Science, and in addition, the scientific exchange of the participants among themselves.

[PASC 2016 GASPI Minisymposium, Lausanne, 8/10 June 2016] (http://www.pasc16.org/program/minisymposia/)  
Asynchronous data-flow driven programming with GASPI.  
The mini-symposium will present four talks from different application domains, which make use of (hybrid) task models and the extended feature set (relative to MPI) of the GASPI API in order to deliver high scalability and a much improved robustness versus jitter. The applications domains are from Life-Sciences, Seismic Imaging, from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and from a work-stealing application in Combustion CFD.

[Exa2ct GASPI Tutorial 2016, EPFL Lausanne, 7th June 2016, 10.00-16.00] (http://www.exa2ct.eu/)  
The GASPI tutorial is taking place in room BC 410 (map), located in the "BC building", on the EPFL campus in Lausanne. The meeting is co-located with PASC 2016 and free of charge. In this GASPI tutorial we present an asynchronous data flow programming model for Partitioned Global Address Spaces (PGAS) as an alternative to the programming model of MPI. GASPI, which stands for Global Address Space Programming Interface, is a partitioned global address space (PGAS) API. The GASPI API is designed as a C/C++/Fortran library and focused on three key objectives: scalability, flexibility and fault tolerance. 

For registration, please contact Christian Simmendinger (christian.simmendinger[at]t-systems-sfr.com) or Tom Vander Aa (Tom.VanderAa[at]imec.be)
